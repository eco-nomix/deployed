        <p>Many people are currently discovering the benefits of CBD.
        CBD is one of the cannabinoids which is found in the cannabis plant. </p>
        <p>One of the most well-known compounds of the cannabis plant is THC or
        tetrahydrocannabinol. Once the THC is broken down by heat and ingested, it can create a
        high. Although THC and CBD both come from the cannabis plant, CBD does not give you a high.</p>

        <p>Some of the established health benefits of CBD include pain relief, reducing
        inflammation, anti-acne, and an antidepressant.</p>

        <p>CBD can be mixed with a gel or cream that can be rubbed onto the skin
        or ingested orally.</p>
        <p>There are many
        things to consider when purchasing CBD as it can come in many different forms.
       </p>
        <p>In order to get the CBD that best suits your needs, two important
        things to consider are the strength and concentration. Other factors to consider
        include purity and the volume of CBD within the product itself.</p>
        <p>CBD has become increasingly popular as a natural way to help
        people try to manage pain, reduce inflammation, and cope with anxiety. But not all CBD oil
        is created equal, meaning it is critical to find the right CBD product for you particular situation.

            <p><strong>Where Was the Hemp Grown
            and What Could Be In It?</strong></p>
            <p>Hemp is capable of absorbing both the good and the bad
            from the air, water, and soil in which it’s grown. This makes it all the more important to
            know that your CBD comes from organically grown hemp that can be tracked to its
            US-grown source. In addition through testing should be preformed on all products you could ingest.
            You don't need your CBD to have accumulated
            toxic substances such as pesticides, herbicides, or heavy metals. These substances have been linked to various
             cancers such as Leukemia, Myeloma, lymphoma and cancers of the skin, lip, stomach,
             brain and prostate.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>How much THC is in the CBD product?</strong></p>
            <p>In order to qualify as a legal hemp product, CBD products must contain less than 0.03% THC.  Make sure your products have low levels, or zero, THC in them. </p>
            <p>Remember even small amounts of THC can cause you to fail a drug test or have mind-altering affects.</p>

            <p><strong>Is the CBD Potent and Pure?</strong></p>
            <ul>The product should be free of
            <li>Pesticides</li>
            <li>Bacteria and Fungus</li>
            <li>Residual Solvents</li>

            <p><strong>How is the CBD Being Extracted?</strong></p>

                      alt="apex co2 extraction" />
            <p>Getting CBD from hemp is a complicated process. The cheapest and easiest ways
            to extract CBD from hemp commonly involve harsh solvents that can leave chemical
            residue in the CBD. The best, and most reliable extraction method, uses carbon dioxide
            (CO<sub>2</sub>) under high pressure and extremely low temperatures to pull out as
            much CBD as possible without introducing contaminants. The CO<sub>2</sub> simply evaporates
            once the pressure is released, leaving virtually no trace of
            extraction on the CBD.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>Benefits of CO<sub>2</sub> Extraction:</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Ensures high quality</li>
            <li>Uses no harsh solvents/chemicals</li>
            <li>Free of butane &amp; propane, and ethanol</li>
            <li>It’s a safe and proven solvent, widely used for foods and dietary supplements</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong> What Claims are Being Made?</strong></p>
            <p>It is a violation of the FDA DSHEA guidelines
            to make medical claims about the efficacy of CBD products in the treatment of
            any medical condition or symptom. Although preliminary research has shown
            tremendous promise of CBD helping people in pretty remarkable ways,
            legitimate CBD companies will refrain from making any direct medical claims.

              alt="is cheaper cbd oil ok to buy" />
             <p><strong>Is Cheaper Better?</strong></p>
            <p>When it comes to CBD, cheaper is most certainly not always better because the
            production of quality CBD just isn’t cheap. CO<sub>2</sub> extraction utilizes
            complex equipment and a high level of expertise as opposed to the cheaper and easier
            chemical extraction processes that can leave residue from toxic solvents like butane,
            propane, and ethanol in the CBD. While the CO<sub>2</sub> extraction might be more expensive
            , it does insure quality, purity, and potency – especially when
            used to extract CBD from hemp that has been organically grown in the United States.</p>
            <p><strong>Reasons Higher-Quality CBD May Cost More</strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Organically grown</li>
            <li>Extracted using CO<sub>2</sub> method</li>
            <li>Higher concentrations of CBD</li>
            <li>Grown in the United States</li>
            <li>Tested in third-party labs</li>
            <li>Made from high-quality, full-spectrum extract, so other beneficial compounds are present</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>Additional Things to Look For</strong></p>
            <p>The CBD product can be enhanced in a number of ways.</p>
            <p>* There could be additional herbal supplements that can both amplify the effects of the CBD alone and the CBD can impact the delivery of the herbal suppliment.</p>
            <p>* The CBD product can be <strong>micro-encapsulated</strong>.  This impacts the absorption of the CBD.  If the product is treated this way, you can find that a smaller dosage can be more effective</p>
            <p>* The CBD Product can be <strong>polarized</strong>.  This also assists in the delivery of the CBD to critical areas of the body.
