                            Digital Gold is a new crypto-currency that is tied directly to the price of Gold.  Please see the white paper as how this operates.

                            How would you like to own significant amounts of a cryptocurrency that actually represents
                            ownership of physical Gold and is at a price that is directly tied to the spot price of Gold?  It is not
                            responsive to speculators pushing the price one way or the other, but subject only to world demand of Gold.
                            This brings about stability to the world of cryptocurrency.

                            Of course, the answer is yes.  But you may find that you don't have the resources to purchase the coins or have the
                            equipment to mine the coins in the traditional manner.  But the idea of a gold-backed currency is pretty exciting, especially
                            when it can be traded using blockchain security.
                        </div>

                            Digital Gold has been designed from the ground-up to allow Agents to Mine the Digital Gold currency through their labor.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            The Labor we seek is to assist Digital Gold in becoming well known and more importantly used as a currency,  in short - Marketing. But to be
                             more specific Digital Gold is seeking Referrals.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            <h2>How It Works</h2>  You become a registered Agent for Digital Gold.  It is a small registration form with a massive $10.00 one-time registration
                            fee.  There are no other fees you are ever obligated to pay.  Since we are paying a cryptocurrency that has real value (gold) only agents may receive this.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            When you recommend someone they will hopefully make a purchase of Digital Gold.  This is actually not as hard as it sounds, as your referral will receive
                             a 10% discount on the price of their Gold.  I didn't say a discount in the fees, but they purchase their Gold for 10% below spot.  This is unheard of, no one, even the
                             large purchasers buy below spot, but typically spot + production costs, coinage costs, shipping and handling costs.  These extra costs can be as high as 10% of spot price.
                             So normal gold purchasers can pay as high as spot + 10%, where Digital Gold is selling it to them for spot - 10%.  That's a pretty substantial savings.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Don't panic, YOU DON'T SELL THEM ANYTHING.  All purchases are made through Digital Gold's Exchange website.  You just referred them to the website.
                            You don't stock any product, and in fact you don't ever have to make any purchase of Digital Gold to receive your Referral Bonus.  By the way, The Referral fee
                            is equal to 10% of their purchase in Digital Coins.  That means if they purchase 1000 Digital Gold Coins you will receive 100 Digital Gold Coins in your
                            personal eWallet to spend how you see fit.  Or even better, sit on it and watch the price go up as the dollar continues to go down in value compared to Gold.  That percentage is constant for any size purchase and applies as long as your referral makes any purchase in the future,
                            even years for now.  No there are no additional fees on your part, ever.  So whenever their purchase is made, your account is credited.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            I know what you are thinking, how can Digital Gold do this?  There is a 10% discount to the purchaser
                            and another 10% referral bonus to the Agent.  How can they have 100% gold behind all of their coins
                            and pay these benefits? It turns out the answer is simple.  Digital Gold has contracted with a
                            mining company to purchase all the Gold they produce over the next many years and they sell
                            the refined gold to us at a substantial discount.  They could have sold their Gold at Spot but they
                            wanted the cryptocurrency holders to have a real benefit.  Note:  the miners can produce the
                            refined gold for much less, so they are still making a good profit.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Not only do you get a referral fee of 10%, but you are also in a unique category of users, you are
                            considered a coin creator.  In Digital Golds system, Coin Creators receive a yield on the Gold they
                            have purchased.  Every time a transaction takes place, Digital Gold receives a transaction fee of 1/2 of 1%.
                            Note that Visa charges 2-4% for a transaction, so this is pretty low.  A portion of every fee paid during the
                            month is in turn paid as a benefit to every coin creator.  The total is proportionally split between all of the Coin
                            Creators.  The fun part is when you realize that this is paid whether you have spent those Created Coins or not.
                            Over the course of the year there can be many transactions on the same Created Coins, as they move from one holder
                            to the next.  The greater the number of transactions, the greater the fee that is paid.  This can amount to between 3-10% of
                            the number of coins created on an annual basis.  But if you consider that if you have already spent your coins, what is the
                            effective rate of return that you are receiving?
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Every time new coins are created through the sales of Gold, this monthly income can continue to grow and grow.  So the question
                            becomes, how many people do you want to be the referrer of?  As an Agent of Digital Gold there isn't a limit to how many
                            individual or companies you can refer.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Unless you are a very active referrer and know people with a lot of money they would like to put in Gold, it's not likely to make a large amount of money
                            with this and retire in the Bahamas.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            However, as an Agent of Digital Gold, you may also refer other people to become Agents like your self.  Hey isn't that a multi-
                            level?  Everyone knows that those are just scams and pyramid schemes, and the guy at the bottom gets nothing.  Well normally yes, but
                            in Digital Gold it is handled quite differently.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                             Yes, We utilize a MLM referral program but with a number of twists to make this really exciting and benefitial to everyone, even the new guy.
                             It was designed to eliminate the member/agent Churn that MLM's typically experience. If you don't
                             know what I'm talking about - member/agent Churn is the agent turnover that takes place
                             in an organization as agent's give up, fail and drop out. Analysis of the major MLMs finds
                             that 60-90% of the total membership drop out annually and need to be replaced.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            For me, it was always getting close to some organization goal, only to have my down-line dropping
                            out as fast as I could recruit replacements. That is really frustrating, and the bottom line,
                            it costs you serious big bucks.  Especially when you realize, it's the guy's at the top that are
                            getting all the bonuses that you missed out on, for whatever reason.  No wonder they are making big bucks.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            A good example of a system that works is a grocery store discount card. About a year ago, after
                            a move to a new state, I looked at my keychain and I had over 10 different grocery store discount
                            cards on it. Why didn't I throw them away earlier? Well I MIGHT just go to that store, and would
                            want to get the discount. Besides, it didn't cost me anything to keep them around, so on they
                            stayed. When I looked at them closely there were cards there I hadn't used in years, and they
                            still would have been there, if there was that store within a 100 miles of me.  Even then I retired them
                            to my glove-box in my car -  just in case.

                            What does it cost someone in your downline to participate in your MLM opportunity on a monthly
                            basis? Each time a member has to write out a check or send a payment in, they will re-evaluate
                            do they really want to keep doing this. If they are making more money each month than it costs
                            them, they will stick around, as long as it doesn't costs too much in their time.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            I saw a recent study on the major MLM's and the average member was making just $13.00 per month. Now
                            that is just not enough to write home to mom about. Especially when they had to buy $20 or more
                            in products to qualify to receive that lousy commission.
                            </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Is your garage getting full of products that you intended to sell, but every time you find someone
                            interested enough to buy them, they become a member to get the discount? Well that sounds great as
                            they are in your downline, until they go away, never having bought your products, you never made a
                            dime off them and your garage is just getting fuller and fuller, because you have to purchase so
                            much every month, more than you use.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Do you really want to buy those products? The better question is would you buy them if you weren't
                            a member trying to maintain a monthly sales requirement? If the answer is no, then those products
                            are truly a cost of doing business. If you are one of the lucky few that is making more money than
                            it costs them to operate (the vast majority), then multi-level might be working for you.

                            organization size if everyone simply stayed? Over time it would grow to be HUGE. And that could

                            personal purchases, or even total volume of sales.  So there are no missed bonuses.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            The bonuses are credited immediately at the time of sale to all 5 generations.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                           The bonuses of Agents are in the form of Digital Gold.  They can be used throughout the Digital Gold cryptocurrency System.
                           This means that anyone can benefit from being an agent of Digital Gold with the registration
                           fee being the only risk.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            In addition once you have a balance on your eWallet, Agents may purchase an Digital Gold Payroll Debit Card.  The Earned Bonuses may
                            be transferred onto the Payroll debit card, so they can be utilized when you want, where
                            you want,  at any location a standard debit or credit card can be used.
                            The cost of this Payroll Debit Card may be deducted from earned Referral Bonuses, therefore
                            no risk at all.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Business cards may also be paid for through earned Referral Bonuses.  Therefore there is NO
                            FINANCIAL RISK to participate in the entire Digital Gold system beyond the registration fee.<br><br>
                            Members may elect to purchase the business cards before there
                            are any earnings to accelerate the growth of their organization, but even that is just a $20.00 fee for the business cards.

                        Think about it, once someone is an Agent there is no reason for them to quit. It costs them nothing to
                        maintain their status, just like the grocery store discount card and if a sales ever takes
                        place, from anywhere in their organization - BONUS. They get an income. How often does that have to happen for them to maintain
                        interest? Even if it is just a few dollars every month- pizza money, they will like it.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Agents can register for literally only $10.00, and even build an organization with practically no
                            out of pocket expenses. Once their income starts to come in through the Referral Bonuses,
                            they can purchase their business cards and obtain their Payroll Debit card with no additional
                            out of pocket expenses. Once income starts to come in, would someone have a reason to quit?
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Your downline doesn't go away. If they ever purchase anything from Digital Gold, you get your
                            bonus, no exceptions, even years from now. The income doesn't flow to the top to some
                            original Agent that is making an outrageous income.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            So how wide can you go? Unlimited. Because of the ease of becoming an Agent, the ability to
                            'test drive' with the company with almost no out of pocket expense, the low cost of becoming an Agent,
                            the odds are significantly improved for someone willing to join your organization. Your
                            business card contains a url that when used, automatically gives you the credit for any sale
                            or new Agent that results from it, even it they don't make the decision now, but later,
                            even if they then use the standard Digitalgold.com url.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            To start your ‘Test Drive’, simply register and pay the $10.00 registration fee, as
                            part of the process, a confirmation email will be sent to you, click on the link in that
                            email, and you will be ready to login.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Once you login, your Referral Link can be found on the website, under the Business Plans tab,
                            then select Referral Links. This can be used like an affiliate link and placed in emails,
                            websites, or anyway you would normally promote another site, but in this case, not only do
                            you benefit from the direct sales, but if they join and recruit others, you receive
                            additional compensation. Can you imagine 5 generations of affiliate bonuses?
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            If you can go really wide, what about each of your downline? They have exactly the same
                            opportunity that you do. With five generations in your downline, your organization can
                            get to the thousands of Agents very quickly. Remember this is a totally new company with
                            unlimited growth opportunities. You are probably the first one in your area.
