                              One of the great distractions from accomplishing our goals is simply money or more so the lack of it.  Money has kept many people from reaching their real goals.
                              Our current societies focus on money as the end goal, has placed on hold most people real dreams and aspirations.

                              Eco-nomix also realizes that a true worthwhile goal is not XX dollars or even XX dollars month, but what can be achieved with it.  Who can you help along the way.  So Eco-nomix has created a
                              system where by your dreams can be realized by helping others realize theirs.

                              We have strived to design a simple yet effective system where everyone can benefit.  If one of your dreams is to become more self-sufficient,  not only can we provide you with the knowledge and products to become so, but a plan whereby you can pay for those products and realize the dream.  We have found that most people want to accomplice their goal of self-sufficiency and that it is worth working for it, a little bit at a time, but with the idea of achieving sub-goals along the path.  With each product that you obtain through purchases or Referral Bonuses, you can become closer to your goal, so not only do we provide the products but a method to obtain them.

                             Eco-nomix's system of bonuses is designed so that the normal person can make enough money to get the things they need to become more self-sufficient.  This is not a get rich scheme, but a way to suppliment your income, so that your goals can come quicker.  There will be some that will work diligently to build the organization and their income will grow proportionately.

                             Could it grow to be a full-time job?  Sure!!  As we add more and more products to the system, There will be more ways to earn bonuses, and add on top of that the large potential organization size that an individual can build, and the potential becomes quite attractive.  But it will not happen overnight, not without effort on your part.  Remember you can add your own stores and products and make income right away.
