KineticGold      name comes from Ecology and Economics

The concept of the company is promoting ecology beneficial products for home owners.

Examples of products we will be selling.   

Aquaponics farming systems
Greenhouses
Herb gardens
Solar System
Food production
Water Purification

Each of the products we will market will help the homeowner to become more prepared for difficult times ahead.  What we are trying to instill is hope in the world.

We will be utilizing a multi-level referral program to promote the website and products.  Hence the economics part of the company 


One of the ideas we had was for a globe to be created from the letters of ECO  using blue and green.  but certainly not limited to it.  The logo should reflect good for the world

Another idea for a business card would be a picture of earth from space.  black card,  white lettering,  somehow KineticGold being integrated into the picture.

This logo will be used on a business card  and  on a debit-card.   We will have our own brand of payment card.

If we like one of your designs, we will want it converted to a business card  and a debit-card layout.   We will continue to work with you developing our entire brand, if we like what we see.  Including main web page graphics.

Most importantly, have fun with this.
