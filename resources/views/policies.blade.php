A homeowner’s insurance policy does not cover business related injuries, or the theft of, or damage to, inventory or business equipment. Eco-Nomix Members need to contact their insurance agent to make certain their business property is protected. In most instances, this may be accomplished with a “Business Pursuit” endorsement to an existing homeowner’s policy.</p>

In such event, Eco-Nomix may, at its sole discretion, impose any sanction it deems necessary and appropriate against such Member or such Member’s positions including termination, or seek immediate injunctive relief without the necessity of posting a bond.</li>
