                  The CBD Care Group Profit-Sharing program requires no knowledge of computers or upfront investment.

                   When someone you refer joins as a member in the CBD Care Group (registers),
                   you can receive Profit-Sharing.
                   <ul>
                        <li>You sponsor them by getting them to the CBD Care Group website  (cbdcaregroups.com)
                        to learn about CBD Care Group.</li>
                        <li>It is the responsibility of the Website to teach them how the system works,
                        and get them to sign up.</li>
                        <li>Registration on the CBD Care Group website is linked to the profit-sharing database.</li>
                        <li>There are no products that you are selling.</li>
                        <li>You have no obligation beyond getting them to the website.  A true referral.</li>
                        <li>Profit-Sharing is for Active members of the CBD Care Group.</li>

                    The below example is only intended to serve as an example of what can happen with the exponential Growth that is possible with
                    CBD Care Group.  This is NOT what you WILL make in Profit-Sharing.  If you make more than a few hundred dollars per month, then
                    then you did a lot of things right and you happened to sponsor the right people with an attitude for success.
                </div>
                <br>&nbsp;<br>
                <div class="col-md-12 standout">
                    We estimate that the average active user of CBD Care Group will purchase $100 in products per month.

             </div>

             <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                With their first purchase, your Profit-Sharing begins.  You will receive as Profit-Sharing 10% of the
                amount your sponsored member purchases.
             </div>
             <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                If your sponsored member purchases $100 of products on the website, you would receive $10 in Profit-Sharing.  This doesn't sound like much but
                <ul>
                    <li>Profit-Sharing will occur EVERY time the sponsored member makes a purchase</li>
                    <li>You will receive 10% Profit-Sharing even for larger purchases ($20 for a $200 purchase)</li>
                    <li>There are no limits to how many people you can sponsor</li>

                 If you sponsored 10 members that average $100 per month in purchases, then you would receive a total of $100 in Profit-Sharing.  There is no limit to the number of people you could sponsor.
                 If you had a 100 sponsored members that average $100 per month in purchases you would receive $1000 in Profit-Sharing.  That's ok, but it sounds like a lot of time
                 to really make a difference.  But here is where you can kick Profit-Sharing into high gear.

             <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                 Once you have sponsored at least 5 members, you qualify for Profit-Sharing of the Second Generation purchasers.

             <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                 Any member can qualify for Profit-Sharing, so after some period of time (hard to predict how long), the members that you
                 sponsored will begin to sponsor their associates.  These are potential Second Generation purchasers and should eventually start to
                 make their own purchases.
             </div>
             <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                 The Profit Sharing you receive from 2nd Generation Purchasers is 4%, but this can start to add up fast.  Lets assume that your sponsored members each
                 sponsored 5 members to qualify for this Profit-Sharing.  Let's assume that they average $100 per month in purchases.
                 <ul>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;5 members in the 1st Generation -  a total of $&nbsp;&nbsp;500 in purchases - $&nbsp;&nbsp;50/month in Profit-Sharing.</li>

                   this Profit-Sharing and the 2nd Generation also sponsored 3 members each.
                   Notice I reduced the average sponsored to allow for those that just won't do anything.
                     Let's assume that they average $100 per month in purchases.

                   Also notice how your potential income drastically increases as you picked up the 4th generation.  This is because you got the people you sponsored to duplicate what you were doing.

                    their own purchases.  But many will be just curious enough to try to sponsor some other people and benefit
