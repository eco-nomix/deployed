                            Eco-Coin is the digital monetary system the world has been waiting for;  simple to understand, high security, international access, and a value pegged to vaulted and insured gold.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Eco-Coin is a title of ownership in digital form, backed by gold and other commodities and created through the act of converting a fixed weight of physical precious metals where the title of ownership is recorded on the Blockchain.
                            The amount of gold per Eco-Coin, hence the value of the Eco-coin is fixed at the ratio of 1/1000 oz of gold per issued coin.
                            Eco-Coins are traded directly from within a unique eWallet System using live price-feeds for buy or sell operations as well as enabling the transfer of coins between accounts.
                            Eco-Coins can be bought by and sold for fiat currencies and can be redeemed in physical metal.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Each transaction of Eco-Coin is levied a small transaction fee.  This fee is shared with parties
                            involved with the creation of the Eco-Coins.  Coin creation starts within the primary market where investors purchase wholesale contracts of physical gold or other recognized commodities which are then converted into digital ownership titles call Eco-Coins.  These eligible investors also receive a generous share of the
                            transfer fee on all subsequent transactions that take place in the secondary market on the coins that they help to create.  These fees will continue with each transaction for the life of the coin.
                            This conversion creates an additional supply of money base (Eco-Coins) and takes place on a wholesale physical trading platform where the metals are securelyallocated,segregated, vaulted and insured.
                            The digital title of the Eco-Coin is then incentivised to be sold on the secondary market platform via blockchain
                            technology which will generate long-term income to the investors.

                            Eco-Coin money base becomes available for buying and selling on the secondary market platform
                            via blockchain technology to individuals and businesses wither directly from within their unique eWallet or through third party distributors.

                            Agents for Eco-Coin are further incentivised to recruit and enroll new Eco-Coin wallet users and receive both a share of initial creation of Eco-Coins and a portion of all future transfer fees associated with those coins.  There is no limitation as to how many individuals an agent may recruit.  Earning are communicated via through app notifications.

                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Merchants are enrolled by Agents of Eco-Coin.  Merchants are not charged any transaction costs for purchases made from them.  This can represent a 2-3% savings over the acceptance of a standard Visa/Mastercard transaction.
                            Merchants are encouraged to pass some of that savings to the purchasers of their products in the form of a reduction of the retail price.  This will encourage purchases to select them over other merchants.

                            Eco-Coin is thus engineered to be a win-win ecosystem of shared-wealth for all participants.  It highly incentivises adoption and the prepensity to transaction.  The higher the volume of transaction, the higher velocity Eco-Coins money reflects;  the higher earnings payout to eligible participants.
                            Entities are thus incentivised to convert, trade, promote and recruit, making Eco-Coin a unique monetary architecture built upon solid low volatility gold backing.  Eco-Coin transactions require no tradition banking systems, and are designed for transfer executions and confirmation to occur within approximately 4 seconds.
                            Eco-Coin is honest money resilient to debasement and manipulation.  It also return stable financial sovereignty to individuals and businesses.  By it's 100% backing by Insured gold holdings, Eco-Coins value will track the physical price of gold itself.  This allows for holdings to automatically benefit from the increased value of gold when compared
                            to a fiat monetary instrument which has no physical backing and is easily based by printing presses.

                            XYZ Limited is launching a revolutionary digital asset call Eco-Coin (Eco-Coin.com).  The ability to bring back the
                            Gold Standard was seen as an urgency to solve a few key inherent problems with physically allocated precious metals and the need to:
                            <li>provide a more liquid solution to transfer gold titles instantaneously,</li>
                            <li>bypass slow and uncompromising traditional banking,</li>

                            Eco-Coin is launched as a perfectly engineered money solution to bring big change to the gold industry.  Eco-Coin is the antidote to monetary debasement inherent to all fiat money
                            systems which create both inflation and deflation via the manipulation of interest rates and the money base (expansion / contraction).  Eco-Coin is independent from the backing of government entities or central banks.
                            Eco-Coin money is high attractive and modelled in unique ways since it is a:
                            <li>real product launch (no ICO involved),</li>

                            A major revolution is taking place with the advent of Blockchain technology and the virtual currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc. driving an almost geometric market growth.  Barring a few exceptions, these crypto-currencies are not asset-backed digital assets and therefore, can experience huge price volatility.  This has been dramatically shown by both the fast rise and fall of most of these currencies that have no intrinsic value.  Because of low velocity, the are driven almost entirely by speculation.

                            Today's financial world is filled with major risks; political, economic and societal.  Eco-Coin was introduced to diminish risk exposure for individuals and institutions by creating a gold backed medium of exchange which focuses on liquidity, trade, exchangeability, independence plus a long term yield.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Eco-Coin sets out to unite the precious metals industry with the digital asset market, but also represent a novelty for the financial markets.  It is a digital asset which solves the historic problem of how gold can generate an uninterrupted yield for eligible participants.  For the first time, Gold is comparable to other investment choices, while retaining their safe haven status and uniquely still being able to act as true money.
                            This is the return to the gold standard through decentralization.

                            be seen as a title of ownership that is easily purchased, exchanged or traded.  Each Eco-Coin is backed by vaulted, insured, physical metal at a fixed weight.  As the price of Gold changes, the price of the Eco-Coin immediately changes.  The settlement value at all times is designed to maintain 1 Eco-Coin to 1/1000 oz of Gold.
