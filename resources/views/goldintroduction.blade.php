                            Digital Gold is a new crypto-currency that is tied directly to the price of Gold.  Please see the white paper as how this operates.

                        Digital Gold has been designed from the ground-up to allow Agents to Mine the currency through their labor.
                         We utilize a MLM referral program with a number of twists to make this really exciting.
                         It was designed to eliminate the member/agent Churn that MLM's typically experience. If you don't
                         know what I'm talking about - member/agent Churn is the member turnover that takes place
                         in an organization as member's give up, fail and drop out. Analysis of the major MLMs finds
                         that 60-90% of the total membership drop out annually and need to be replaced.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                        For me, it was always getting close to some organization goal, only to have my down-line dropping
                        out as fast as I could recruit replacements. That is really frustrating, and the bottom line,
                        it costs you serious big bucks.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                        A good example of a system that works is a grocery store discount card. About a year ago, after
                        a move to a new state, I looked at my keychain and I had over 10 different grocery store discount
                        cards on it. Why didn't I throw them away earlier? Well I MIGHT just go to that store, and would
                        want to get the discount. Besides, it didn't cost me anything to keep them around, so on they
                        stayed. When I looked at them closely there were cards there I hadn't used in years, and they
                        still would have been there, if there was that store within a 100 miles of me.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                        What does it cost someone in your downline to participate in your MLM opportunity on a monthly
                        basis? Each time a member has to write out a check or send a payment in, they will re-evaluate
                        do they really want to keep doing this. If they are making more money each month than it costs
                        them, they will stick around, as long as it doesn't costs too much in their time.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                        I saw a study on the major MLM's and the average member was making just $13.00 per month. Now
                        that is just not enough to write home to mom about. Especially when they had to buy $20 or more
                        in products to qualify to receive commissions.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                        Is your garage getting full of products that you intend to sell, but every time you find someone
                        interested enough to buy them, they become a member to get the discount? Well that sounds great as
                        they are in your downline, until they go away, never having bought your products, you never made a
                        dime off them and your garage is just getting fuller and fuller, because you have to purchase so
                        much every month, more than you use.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                        Do you really want to buy those products? The better question is would you buy them if you weren't
                        a member trying to maintain a monthly sales requirement? If the answer is no, then those products
                        are truly a cost of doing business. If you are one of the lucky few that is making more money than
                        it costs them to operate (the vast majority), then it might be working for you.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                        Any question why there is so much member churn out there?
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                        Digital Gold is introducing a whole new way of growing a business, one where there is no motivation
                        for your down-line to get discouraged and quit your organization. What would happen to your
                        organization size if everyone simply stayed? Over time it would grow to be HUGE. And that could
                        translate to a significant income for you.

                        Well what is Digital Gold all about? It is a company that specializes
                        in allowing individuals to benefit from owning Gold without all the negatives that are associated
                        with keeping physical gold.

                           The bonuses of Agents are in the form of Digital Gold.  They can be used throughout the Digital Gold cryptocurrency System
                           system.
                            This means that anyone can benefit from being an agent of Eco-Coin with the registration

                            be transferred onto the Payroll debit card, so they can be utilized when you want, where
                            you want,  at any location a standard debit or credit card can be used.
                            The cost of this Payroll Debit Card may be deducted from earned Referral Bonuses, therefore
                            no risk at all.

                            Members may elect to purchase the business cards  before there
                            are sufficient earnings to accelerate their organization, but even that is just a $20.00 fee for the business cards.

                        Think about it, once someone is an Agent there is no reason for them to quit. It costs them nothing to

                        place - BONUS. They get an income. How often does that have to happen for them to maintain
                        interest? Even if it is just a few dollars - pizza money, they will like it.

                         they can purchase their business cards and obtain their Payroll Debit card with additional
                          out of pocket expenses. Once income starts to come in, would someone have a reason to quit?

                        Your downline doesn't go away. If they ever purchase anything from Digital Gold, you get your
                        bonus, no exceptions, even years from now. The income doesn't flow to the top to some
                        original Agent that is making an outrageous income.

                        So how wide can you go? Unlimited. Because of the ease of becoming an Agent, the ability to
                        'test drive' with the company with almost no out of pocket expense, the low cost of becoming an Agent,
                        the odds are significantly improved for someone willing to join your organization. Your
                        business card contains a url that when used, automatically gives you the credit for any sale
                        or new Agent that results from it, even it they don't make the decision now, but later,
                        even if they then use the standard Digitalgold.com url.

                        To start your ‘Test Drive’, simply register and pay the $10.00 registration fee, as
                        part of the process, a confirmation email will be sent to you, click on the link in that
                        email, and you will be ready to login.

                        Once you login, your Referral Link can be found on the website, under the Business Plans tab,
                        then select Referral Links. This can be used like an affiliate link and placed in emails,
                        websites, or anyway you would normally promote another site, but in this case, not only do
                        you benefit from the direct sales, but if they join and recruit others, you receive
                        additional compensation. Can you imagine 5 generations of affiliate bonuses?

                        If you can go really wide, what about each of your downline? They have exactly the same
                        opportunity that you do. With five generations in your downline, your organization can
                        get to the thousands of members very quickly. Remember this is a totally new company with
                        unlimited growth opportunities. You are probably the first one in your area.
