        <p>Many people are currently discovering the benefits of CBD.
        CBD is one of the cannabinoids which is found in the cannabis plant. </p>
        <p>One of the most well-known compounds of the cannabis plant is THC or
        tetrahydrocannabinol. Once the THC is broken down by heat and ingested, it can create a
        high. Although THC and CBD both come from the cannabis plant, CBD does not give you a high.</p>

        <p>Some of the established health benefits of CBD include pain relief, reducing
        inflammation, anti-acne, and an antidepressant.</p>

        <p>CBD can be mixed with a gel or cream that can be rubbed onto the skin
        or ingested orally.</p>
        <p>There are many
        things to consider when purchasing CBD as it can come in many different forms.
       </p>
        <p>In order to get the CBD that best suits your needs, two important
        things to consider are the strength and concentration. Other factors to consider
        include purity and the volume of CBD within the product itself.</p>
        <p>CBD has become increasingly popular as a natural way to help
        people try to manage pain, reduce inflammation, and cope with anxiety. But not all CBD oil
        is created equal, meaning it is critical to find the right CBD product for you particular situation.

        alt="cbd hemp growing in a field" width="300" height="200" />1.  Where Was the Hemp Grown
        and What Might Be In It?</strong></p>
        <p>Hemp is a bioaccumulator, meaning it is capable of absorbing both the good and the bad
        from the air, water, and soil in which it’s grown. This makes it all the more important to
        know that your CBD oil comes from organically grown hemp that can be tracked to its
        US-grown source. The last thing buyers want is for their CBD oil to have accumulated
        toxic substances such as pesticides, herbicides, or heavy metals. For decades,
        farmers have used pesticides to protect crops against insects, disease, and fungi –
        and have used herbicides to control weeds – but we’ve known for quite some time that
        chemicals used to harm other species can also be harmful to our own species. That’s
        one big reason behind the global push to go organic. People are starting to prioritize
        organic crops, whether you’re talking about fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts,
        livestock feed – even textiles like cotton, wool, and flax.</p>
