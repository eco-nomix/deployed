                            Eco-Coin is the digital monetary system the world has been waiting for;  simple to understand, high security, international access, and a value pegged to vaulted and insured gold.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Eco-Coin is a title of ownership in digital form, backed by gold and other commodities and created through the act of converting a fixed weight of physical precious metals where the title of ownership is recorded on the Blockchain.
                            The amount of gold per Eco-Coin, hence the value of the Eco-coin is fixed at the ratio of 1/1000 oz of gold per issued coin.
                            Eco-Coins are traded directly from within a unique eWallet System using live price-feeds for buy or sell operations as well as enabling the transfer of coins between accounts.
                            Eco-Coins can be bought by and sold for fiat currencies and can be redeemed in physical metal.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Each transaction of Eco-Coin is levied a small transaction fee.  This fee is shared with parties
                            involved with the creation of the Eco-Coins.  Coin creation starts within the primary market where investors purchase wholesale contracts of physical gold or other recognized commodities which are then converted into digital ownership titles call Eco-Coins.  These eligible investors also receive a generous share of the
                            transfer fee on all subsequent transactions that take place in the secondary market on the coins that they help to create.  These fees will continue with each transaction for the life of the coin.
                            This conversion creates an additional supply of money base (Eco-Coins) and takes place on a wholesale physical trading platform where the metals are securelyallocated,segregated, vaulted and insured.
                            The digital title of the Eco-Coin is then incentivised to be sold on the secondary market platform via blockchain
                            technology which will generate long-term income to the investors.

                        </div>

                            Eco-Coin money base becomes available for buying and selling on the secondary market platform
                            via blockchain technology to individuals and businesses wither directly from within their unique eWallet or through third party distributors.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Agents for Eco-Coin are further incentivised to recruit and enroll new Eco-Coin wallet users and receive both a share of initial creation of Eco-Coins and a portion of all future transfer fees associated with those coins.  There is no limitation as to how many individuals an agent may recruit.  Earning are communicated via through app notifications.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Merchants are enrolled by Agents of Eco-Coin.  Merchants are not charged any transaction costs for purchases made from them.  This can represent a 2-3% savings over the acceptance of a standard Visa/Mastercard transaction.
                            Merchants are encouraged to pass some of that savings to the purchasers of their products in the form of a reduction of the retail price.  This will encourage purchases to select them over other merchants.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Eco-Coin is thus engineered to be a win-win ecosystem of shared-wealth for all participants.  It highly incentivises adoption and the prepensity to transaction.  The higher the volume of transaction, the higher velocity Eco-Coins money reflects;  the higher earnings payout to eligible participants.
                            Entities are thus incentivised to convert, trade, promote and recruit, making Eco-Coin a unique monetary architecture built upon solid low volatility gold backing.  Eco-Coin transactions require no tradition banking systems, and are designed for transfer executions and confirmation to occur within approximately 4 seconds.
                            Eco-Coin is honest money resilient to debasement and manipulation.  It also return stable financial sovereignty to individuals and businesses.  By it's 100% backing by Insured gold holdings, Eco-Coins value will track the physical price of gold itself.  This allows for holdings to automatically benefit from the increased value of gold when compared
                            to a fiat monetary instrument which has no physical backing and is easily based by printing presses.

                            XYZ Limited is launching a revolutionary digital asset call Eco-Coin (Eco-Coin.com).  The ability to bring back the
                            Gold Standard was seen as an urgency to solve a few key inherent problems with physically allocated precious metals and the need to:
                            <li>provide a more liquid solution to transfer gold titles instantaneously,</li>
                            <li>bypass slow and uncompromising traditional banking,</li>
                            <li>create gold income generating assets for individuals, companies and institutions,</li>
                            <li>move away from ETF's that are often used to suppress gold prices.</li>

                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Eco-Coin is launched as a perfectly engineered money solution to bring big change to the gold industry.  Eco-Coin is the antidote to monetary debasement inherent to all fiat money
                            systems which create both inflation and deflation via the manipulation of interest rates and the money base (expansion / contraction).  Eco-Coin is independent from the backing of government entities or central banks.
                            Eco-Coin money is high attractive and modelled in unique ways since it is a:
                            <li>real product launch (no ICO involved),</li>
                            <li>100% asset backed,</li>

                            A major revolution is taking place with the advent of Blockchain technology and the virtual currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc. driving an almost geometric market growth.  Barring a few exceptions, these crypto-currencies are not asset-backed digital assets and therefore, can experience huge price volatility.  This has been dramatically shown by both the fast rise and fall of most of these currencies that have no intrinsic value.  Because of low velocity, the are driven almost entirely by speculation.

                            Today's financial world is filled with major risks; political, economic and societal.  Eco-Coin was introduced to diminish risk exposure for individuals and institutions by creating a gold backed medium of exchange which focuses on liquidity, trade, exchangeability, independence plus a long term yield.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            Eco-Coin sets out to unite the precious metals industry with the digital asset market, but also represent a novelty for the financial markets.  It is a digital asset which solves the historic problem of how gold can generate an uninterrupted yield for eligible participants.  For the first time, Gold is comparable to other investment choices, while retaining their safe haven status and uniquely still being able to act as true money.
                            This is the return to the gold standard through decentralization.

                            Eco-Coin is an asset backed medium of exchange with intrinsic value and limited volatility.  Each unit can
                            be seen as a title of ownership that is easily purchased, exchanged or traded.  Each Eco-Coin is backed by vaulted, insured, physical metal at a fixed weight.  As the price of Gold changes, the price of the Eco-Coin immediately changes.  The settlement value at all times is designed to maintain 1 Eco-Coin to 1/1000 oz of Gold.

                            Historically Gold is one of the best stores of value, however, it is perceived by the financial industry to have
                            a monumental weakness namely that they produce no yield (income return) and are thus priced and treated as commodities.

                            Eco-Coin solves this problem without compromising its asset backing.  Pension Funds and Institutions for the first time will be able to invest in Gold and receive a yield without compromising the asset base.  Eco-Coin allows a reserve currency surrogate for fiat currencies which by their nature are being typically devalued.

                            Fiat money is a currency enforced as legal tender by government decree that differs significantly
                            from physical gold money since it is open to supply and contraction manipulations. Fiat currency is
                            issued as debt by central and member banks. i.e. a government, institution or individual takes a loan
                            (IOU) from banks at interest, but the interest amount to pay back the debt is never created, forcing
                            the financial system to perpetually search for ways to extract “growth” to pay back the interest, and
                            because of this the current monetary system is in continuous imbalance, with unsustainable deficit
                            spending, exploitation and bankruptcies.
                        </div>
                        <div class="form-group col-md-12 ">
                            A new loan is created through an accounting entry as a new bank deposit and on the other side an
                            accounting entry is made for the debt, so when the debt is repaid, the currency is extinguished. Fiat
                            currencies are promissory notes and have no intrinsic asset value.
                        </div>

                            It is two sides of the same coin. When fiat currency is printed, debt is issued; when debt is paid-off,
                            currency is destroyed. If all the debt today were repaid, there would be no currency left.
                            By definition, the increase in fiat money supply creates price inflation of goods and services due to
                            the value devaluation of the currency itself and a contraction creates deflation. Both are harmful
                            since they rob from savers and destroy wealth. The world´s debts, therefore, can never be paid off by
                            definition and balancing government budgets or eliminating deficits is therefore an impossibility.

                            Fiat currencies lose purchasing power (wealth shrinking) over time like a leaking bag of water. The
                            global debt based fractional financial system model is an extractive “Ponzi” scheme, abusive,
                            destructive and unethical in nature - mathematically doomed to fail. The current financial system
                            prefers to compare exchange rates with other fiat currencies. This is because they are all “leaking
                            bags of water” and are all losing value through devaluation. Physical gold however, is a
                            stable benchmark that cannot be debased. Therefore ongoing price suppression practice by banks
                            and central banks take place through paper certificates manipulation which can be printed “out of
                            thin air” to ensure gold cannot be used as a benchmark to reflect how much purchasing
                            power is being lost by fiat currencies.

                            Only physical gold can be considered as money since it carries no counterpart risk. It
                            cannot be created “out of thin air” and is not created as debt and generates no inflation. It is
                            the best store of value for over 5,000 years. Physical gold money is honest money, it is
                            debt-free and most importantly, free of interest and is an excellent store of wealth over time. Interest
                            (usury or money earned from the loaning of money) is banned in both Christianity and Islam, making physical gold
                            the only compliant form of money since interest cannot be charged.

                             The era of fiat central banking is in terminal decline, it has brought the global economy into a serious
                             turmoil, and all serious experts are predicting a repeat of 2008 - just much, much worse. Globally,
                             there are less good jobs, more unfunded entitlements, speculation, increased risks, bankruptcies,
                             authoritarianism, loss of freedoms, austerity and wars. High level financial fraud is pervasive and
                             unpunished, invasion of privacy, erosion of free speech and loss of liberty is formed to quell unrest.
                             Bailouts and bail-ins are frequent where losses are socialised and profits are privatised. Individuals
                             no longer feel they have a voice or control over their destiny and financial sovereignty. Banks now
                             impose limitations on transfers, cash withdrawals and charge exorbitant, unjustifiable fees and even
                             negative interest rates. With plans to eliminate cash, all transactions will be forced to go through
                             banks depriving individuals of their financial sovereignty and anonymity. Bank runs will not be
                             permitted and bail-ins and bail-outs will be automated. George Orwell's “1984” vision will be fulfilled.

                            These negative trends have accelerated since the two key events in 2001 and 2008. It is precisely for
                            these reasons that cryptocurrencies since 2009 have increased in popularity to provide safety-nets
                            where individuals can to a degree control their own financial dignity and hedge against market
                            manipulations without interference and freely trade outside of the fiat monetary system.

                            Demand for physical gold and silver is being driven by a flight to safety and lack of trust. Very
                            significant demand is coming from savers. Physical and allocated ownership are preferred to
                            minimise counterpart risk.

                            Yet, savers of physical Gold suffer from the lack of price discovery which is suppressed
                            through the manipulation of speculative “paper certificate” trade and cheap access to central bank
                            fiat credit by large institutions and banks. It is an absurdity that future contracts which rarely end up
                            as physical delivery dictate the physical gold and silver prices. It is truly the equivalent of the tail
                            wagging the dog. The only way to change this trend is for physical gold and silver to offer an
                            attractive yield whilst still offering allocated physical metal backing.

                                <li>The Eco-Coins are traded at spot price. No cost for production, storage or insurance.</li>
                                <li>Creators are credited with a distribution based upon velocity, even if they have spent their credits, this distribution can last years beyond their initial investment.</li>

                            Eco-Coin Network uses industry-standard public-key cryptography tools and techniques, which means the code is well tested and understood.
                            To authorize transactions, the initiator must generate its hash, using SHA256 algorithm, and sign it with a privatekey.  These steps cryptographically provide proof
                            that the sender was authorised to make the transaction.
