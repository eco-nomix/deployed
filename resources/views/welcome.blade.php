            <p>Kinetic Gold is a new cryptocurrency that is in its Pre-Launch phase.  </p>
            <p>Unlike any other cryptocurrency, Kinetic Gold has been designed to be utilized like a standard bank account
               on a regular basis for normal banking activities.
               Features like payroll deposit, ATM access, Debit Card Access and on-line banking are among the standard
               banking features to be available.</p>
            <p>You will be able to access your Kinetic Gold account to make payments at any local merchants that accept Visa/Mastercard.</p>
            <p>There are no minimum or maximum transaction sizes.</p>
            <p>Transaction charge is 1/2 of 1% of the transaction.</p>
            <p>Unlike your standard bank account, your account is denominated in ounces of Gold, insured to the full value
               of your deposits (no $250,000 limit) by Lloyds of London, and can be used within any country.</p>
            <p>The cryptocurrency feature of decentralized transactions allows full privacy of banking, having no
               regards to national borders or transaction amounts.</p>

            <p>By its design Kinetic Gold is designed to be a benefit to the small account holder, allowing them the
               same benefits as the large account holder.  The Rewards and Profit Sharing applies for all account holders.
               Just by using Kinetic Gold like your standard bank account you automatically qualify for a significant amount
               of Rewards.  Without changing your income or spending habits, you see large benefits.  The Rewards alone can
               add up to hundreds of dollars worth of Gold to your account on a monthly basis.

             Kinetic Gold's Coin
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="display back-white  col-md-10 col-md-offset-1" >
            <p>Kinetic Gold's coin is equivalent to 1 oz of fine gold at spot value.  This is established by
               requiring that before any coin can be issued that there is at least one ounce of Gold
               in our insured vaults that is not guaranteeing any other coin.  The coin technically represents
               a warehouse receipt for 1 ounce of Gold at spot price.</p>
            <p>When a member makes a deposit to purchase a coin, the deposit funds are used to purchase additional
               gold for Kinetic Gold's reserves.  </p>
            <p>The Spot price of gold is essentially it's wholesale price.  This means that you control one ounce
               of Gold per Coin purchased without having to pay minting costs, vaulting costs, insurance or shipping.
               When a standard purchase of coins or bullion is made these costs will be incurred which could reach
               as high as 10% of the purchase.  The price of Gold would have to increase by this amount before you would
               see a profit.</p>
            <p>With your Kinetic Gold account, if spot price changes just 1%, the value of your account will adjust accordingly.</p>
            <p>With any deposit (purchase of coins) the value of the coin is reestablished to spot price</p>
            <p>Unlike other cryptocurrencies, the value of the coin is not determined by scarcity as additional
               coins are being added continuously along with additional gold deposits.  It is always tied directly to the spot price of
               gold for either purchases or transfers.</p>

            <p>Kinetic Gold's blockchain is one of the fastest block chains available.</p>
            <p>Transaction times are in the millisecond range, making transactions seem almost instantaneous from any
               two points in the world.</p>
            <p>Initally Kinetic Gold will use starchain and will migrate over to even a faster system that will be able to keep
               up with the anticipated growth and number of transactions of Kinetic Gold.</p>
            <p>All transactions will automatically encrypt all elements of the transaction, keeping your private transactions private.</p>
            <p>The Blockchain contains all the rules and regulations regarding purchase and transactions of Kinetic Gold.  This includes all Rewards
               and profit sharing.  This ensures that each members account if safe, secure and that all appropriate rewards and profit sharing is automatically
               credited to those accounts that earn it.</p>

                <p>The Vaulted Storage will interface with the Off-shore Banking system to convert Gold back into fiat currency
                   when needed to cover banking transactions of the account holders.  Only when Coins are converted into fiat currency and are removed
                   from the system can the equivalent amount of Gold be sold</p>

         <p>Kinetic Gold will also obtain an off-shore bank that will provide the on-line access and Debit card access to the account.</p>
         <p>Kinetic Gold will make an initial deposit into the insured vaults a minimum of 1000 kg of hallmarked gold prior to Launch.
            This base amount of Gold is used during the deposit process to set the initial value of new coins.</p>
         <p>Coins purchased during the ICO will be purchased at a discount below spot price.  The amount of the discount is determined
            by the number of Coins purchased.  The ICO amount will be used to purchase the Gold represented by the ICO funds.  The gold
            from the ICO will be used to back the coins issued once Kinetic Gold is launched.
            This backing lasts only during the period that the fiat currency of the deposit is used to purchase additional gold.  Once
            the additional gold is deposited the backing is no longer needed.  This backing period will be completed within 6 months and
            then the Coins for the ICO will be issued.</p>
         <p>Release of ICO coins are controlled by the blockchain.</p>
